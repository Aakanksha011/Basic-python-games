# Basic-python-games
Contains basic level 7 to 8 python command line games.

1.Madlib
In traditional Madlib,you would have a bunch of blanks in a paragraph.And you need to fill out those blanks and 
then read the paragraph out loud with the words that they chose in those  blanks.
Here, I have recreated this project using string concatenation by adding those blanks and sentences together.

2.Quiz game
I have used majorly if else statement to print the questions and corresponding answers.

3.Guess the number (computer)
This is a guessing game where computer has the secret number and we are trying to guess that secret number.
For this, I have imported random module and then simply with randint function I have build the logic.

4.Guess the number (user)
This third  game is the inverse of that function ,we can come up with a secret number and we can have the computer 
to guess it.

5.Rock paper scissor (method 1)
In this method of rock paper scissors, I have used random module with randint function and a series of if else loop 
in oreder to get to see computers choice as well as user's choice.

6.Rock paper scissor (method 2)
In this second method of rock paper scissors, I have used random module with random.choice function with some if 
else loops and functions.

7. Choose your adventure game 
In this I have created a series of loops with some game situation where the user have to choose one of the 2 options 
and then continue the game.

8.Hangman
In this traditional hangman game,it is a game for two in which one player tries to guess the letters of a word, 
the other player recording failed attempts by drawing a gallows and someone hanging on it, line by line.Here, 
mainly I have created three files 1 for having the list of random number of words second for the visual 
presentation of hangman and third for writing the game.
